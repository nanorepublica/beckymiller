_CandleLight_ offers the option for both candle light and electric light depending on the mood and occasion.  The two lighting functions  influence each other; as the candle is burnt, so the shade of the electric blub concealed in the wax evolves.  Equally, the design of an 'electric candle', makes the act of turning on a light a more concious and poigant one, whether flicking a switch or lighting a wick.  
Once the wick is burnt down, there will remain a well in the wax to fit a small nightlight so that the candle can still be used as a source of light if desired.
