An electric watering can which mimics the rythmn of its common counterpart.  By way of rechargable batteries concealed inside, a blub in the spout and a tilt switch, light can be poured out for use.  When the batteries are empty, plug in at the mains to recharge.  As with [Je ne suis pas un robinet](robinet1.html) the hope is that people might become more conscious of the energy they are using.  Supplied with mains charger and dipcoated steel wall hook.

Exhibited at _Brill Burt + Cardens Graduate's Show 2007_ and [New Designers 2007](http://www.core77.com/blog/education/u_of_brighton_london_new_designers_sneak_preview_6574.asp), London.
