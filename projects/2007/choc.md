Re-packaging a product that is commonly associated with obesity and excess as a medicine highlights our current obsession with our diet and health.  The familiar colour, smell and name of the product on one hand seem to contradict its physical form as a medicine promising improved health, yet there are also complimentry associations of addiction and side effects.

On closer inspection the product has a twist.  This is _raw chocolate_, the purest, least processed form of chocolate which has many arguable health benefits.  For more information on raw chocolate, visit [www.rawchoshop.com](http://www.rawchocshop.com/whyraw.asp).

Exhibited at _Brill Burt + Cardens Graduate's Show 2007_ and [New Designers 2007](http://www.core77.com/blog/education/u_of_brighton_london_new_designers_sneak_preview_6574.asp), London.
