_Talking Products_ is an exhibtion of five subverted consumer objects:
chocolate ([500mg chocolate]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/choc)),
a watering can ([Je ne suis pas un arossoir]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/arossoir)),
a garden hose pipe ([Je ne suis pas un robient]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/robinet)),
a break glass emergency key box ([In Case of Emergency]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/emergency)) and
a piggy bank ([This Little Piggy]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/piggy)).

The objects presented in Talking Products are designed with the intention of encouraging people to think more about their habits as consumers and the objects and resources which they take for granted. By subverting and recontextualising familiar objects, the pieces interrupt and disturb the accepted relationship we have with them. The title of the collection is intended to allude to the idea that the products have something to say and are not content to simply be the objects of our desires; they serve to shift the focus of responsibility from the manufacturer to the consumer.

Exhibtion includes working prototypes of all objects, information graphics, interactive Flash screen narative and information CD.  View the Flash narative for Talking Products [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/media/swf/talkingproducts.swf).

Exhibited at _Brill Burt + Carden's Graduate's Show 2007_ (Brighton), and [New Designers 2007, London](http://www.core77.com/blog/education/u_of_brighton_london_new_designers_sneak_preview_6574.asp).
