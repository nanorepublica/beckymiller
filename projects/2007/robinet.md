_Je ne suis pas un robinet_ captures a surreal moment where water and electricity seem to mix.  By juxtaposing water and electricity, the user might feel useasy about the compulsion to turn the tap.  However, no water is involved in the design.  Instead all the associated visual references are intended to shift the focus to the power supply rather than the light itself.

Exhibited at _Brill Burt + Cardens Graduate's Show 2007_ and [New Designers 2007](http://www.core77.com/blog/education/u_of_brighton_london_new_designers_sneak_preview_6574.asp), London.
