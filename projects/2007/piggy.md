_This Little Piggy_ subverts the traditional piggy bank.  The user rears the pigglet to fatterned pig by saving coins.  They decide when to slaughter their pig and cash in.  The growing physical presence of the pig reinstates money as a tangible commodity.  Being personally responsible for giving form to their piggy the user may decide more carefully when and how to spend.  
Prehaps more suited to the budget of the younger consumer, this could be seen as an educational toy.

Exhibited at _Brill Burt + Cardens Graduate's Show 2007_ and [New Designers 2007](http://www.core77.com/blog/education/u_of_brighton_london_new_designers_sneak_preview_6574.asp), London.
