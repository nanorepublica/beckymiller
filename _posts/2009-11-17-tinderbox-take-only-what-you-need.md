__Tinderbox: take only what you need__  
>_A [tinderbox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinderbox) is a small container containing flint, firesteel, and tinder (typically charcloth, but possibly a small quantity of dry, finely-divided fibrous matter such as straw), used together to help kindle a fire._  (Wikipedia)  
[Tinderbox](http://www.dopplr.com/place/gb/london/eat/tinderbox) is also a cafe is Islington, London, containing the ingredients to make a good hot drink.  Interesting how the small sign on the wall asking customers to be frugal with their hot drink additives also resonates with the respect that must have been associated with the cafe's namesake.  A tenuous connection but it made me think.  (Apologies for the poor quality photo, but you can go for a cuppa and see for yourself).
