__Heart__  
Have you visted [Daniel Eatock's website](http://www.danieleatock.com/)?  Its worth a good nose around.  Full of thoughtful and oblique  observations and experiments, it is also built using [Indexhibit](http://www.indexhibit.org/history/) which Eatock has pioneered as a community web project for promoting content focused websites.  
The matter of fact aesthetic of the site merged with Eatock's off beat logic is addictive.  If you're inspired by his narative you can contribute to [Thank You Pictures](http://www.danieleatock.com/project/thank-you-photographs/).
