__Union Chapel__  
Have you visited the Union Chapel in Islington?â€¨  
Shroud in scaffold outside, you might have never noticed the Union Chapel which makes only a modest impact on the London skyline and Islington's busy Upper Street. But once inside, without fail people are easily overwhelmed by the sancturay and sense of calm which prevails. Every detail and corner of this building has an honest and unassuming beauty which feels like a rare find nowadays. The charm of the Union Chapel will only grow on you the more you visit. Don't take my word for it, go and see for yourself.
