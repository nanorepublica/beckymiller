__Kew__  
Making the most of unemployment, I cycled with two other recently jobless friends to Kew Gardens.  Apart from the cycle there, my personal highlight was the lily pond glass house.  We were lucky to go when there was only a couple of others inside.  The atmosphere was one of complete tranquility and serenity, the dark still pond like a portal to parallel world.
