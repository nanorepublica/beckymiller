__Morceaux de Sucre__  
Sugar cubes in France seem more popular than powder, so I bought a box to try them out.  We don't take sugar in our tea in our flat so we ended up having fun with them instead.  A cheap alternative to lego that are good for building igloos with.  280 blocks in a set for only 1â‚¬50 and they sparkle like ice too. Sweet!
