__Gum__  
This another great food innovation I discovered a couple of months ago now.  I've seen quite alot of attempts at new ways of clearing up chewed up chewing gum.  Its so refreshing to see a product that has cut right to the core of the issue and reinvented the stick of chewing gum.  The name is Chicza and its organicly grow and 100% biodegradable.  There are 3 keys points: the gum is made from all natural ingredients, the main one being being natural latex, tapped from rainforst trees which sustain the supply for up to 300 years; the gum production employs cooperatives of workers who receive a fair price for their labour; the gum is totally natural and biodegradable, free from sticky non-biodegrable polymers so will return to the ground with the fallen leaves.  
Available in 3 flavours at [Whacca restaurants](http://www.foodepedia.co.uk/restaurant-news/2009/apr/Wahaca%20_introduces_%20first_biodegradable_chewing_gum.htm) and also Waitrose, Whole Foods, Planet Organic and a few others.  Check out the official [Chicza website](http://chicza.com/index.html) for the full story.
