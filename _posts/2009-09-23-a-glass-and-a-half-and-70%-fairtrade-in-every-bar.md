__A glass and a half and 70% Fairtrade in every bar__
<br>It was all very controversial when Green & Blacks sold out to Cadbury Schwepps a couple of years ago.  Well looks like some maya gold dust has rubbed off on one of the most established names in chocolate.  What a nice suprise to see the new Dairy Milk packaging sporting the little green and blue fairtrade logo on the bottom left of the wrapper.  A common sense appraoch to sustainable confectionary design I think.  So now there is even more choice for the ethical chocoholic and for anyone else looking for a chocolate fix, their craving will be ensuring a good days work for the cocao bean farmers in Ghana.  
In fact Cadbury's was an innovator in social change and workers rights its early years, so this a comforting reminder that their values are still in tact and turning wheels.  Read more about Cadbury's Fairtrade and other interesting stuff they have up their sleve on the [Cadbury Fairtrade Blog](http://cadburydairymilk.typepad.com/fairtrade/about.html).
