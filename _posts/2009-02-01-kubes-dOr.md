__Kubes d'Or__  
One lump or two.  I stumbled on these stock cubes in the supermarket in France.  Packed into a bright little red and yellow box, each of the 16  perfectly wrapped golden bars contains 2 stock cubes, so you are never left with half a crumbly stock cube.  A thoughtful bit of design and a bit like peas in a pod.
