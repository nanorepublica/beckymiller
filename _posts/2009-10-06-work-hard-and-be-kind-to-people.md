__Work Hard and Be Kind to people__  
The words that graphic design studio [IMAGIST](http://www.imagistlondon.com/) London work by.  I was lucky enough to do a placement with them over the summer where among other kind things they did for me, they have lent me a few books from their shelf.  I am new to the rules of graphic design and typography so I am very gratful of the chance to share their books and keep learning.  
A couple of other kind and forward thinking companies who understand the importance of sharing knowledge and books are [howies](http://www.howies.co.uk/content.php?xSecId=10) who also have bookshelves in their shops, and [72 Rivington Street](http://72rivingtonstreet.com/library/) in London, whose library I have recently joined.  
By the way, [One Red Paperclip](http://oneredpaperclip.blogspot.com/) is not a zen guide to stationary items for designers but after reading I definately want to take a leaf out of that book.
