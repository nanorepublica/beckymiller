__In Residence__  
I have been helping out at the Design Museum office this week and been checking out the work of their new Designers in Residence for 2009-2010.  I was snapping some pictures of [Dave Bowker's](http://www.designingthenews.com/about) new wayfinding system for the museum which makes thoughtful reference to the architecture of the building, the images are [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/30980611@N02/).  Also interesting are Asif Khan's dry freezing research and plastination experiments - his latest update is [here](http://inresidence.designmuseum.org/updates/2009/9/15/freeze-drying.html).
