[The DO Lectures](http://www.thedolectures.com)  
Just got back from a weekend in West Wales at the DO Lectures and I feel very privillaged to have been there indeed.  The four days of inspiring lectures were organised and the brainchild of [howies](http://www.howies.co.uk).  The idea is simply to inspire people to do stuff.  There was a truely diverse set of people from surfer Andy Cummins to Scientist Micheal Brangarht.  It will take a while for all the information and wise words to settle I think.  An unexpected favorite was the gingerbread and [Russell Davies](http://russelldavies.typepad.com). I also met [Tom Fishburne](http://www.tomfishburne.com) from [Method](http://www.methodproducts.co.uk), who is doing some great work.  
All of the lectures were filmed and can be viewed online at [www.thedolectures.com](http://www.thedolectures.com).  A huge thank you to everyone at howies and Fforest Farm.  Amazing.  
Dick Darserty said don't just stand there.  Do something.  
Worrying is like a rocking chair it gives you something to do but gets you nowhere.
