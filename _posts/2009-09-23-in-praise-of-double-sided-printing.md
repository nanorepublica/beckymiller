<p>23.09.09 <strong>In praise of Double Sided Printing</strong>
<br>This post is in praise of double sided printing.  Did you know that paper makes up ?? % of office consumption in the UK.  Thats a fact.  So logic says that to reduce this by half you use half the paper, which leads nicely to printing double sided.  Other benefits would include half price paper bills and half price labour costs on stapling.  Just as Pret now do a slim sandwich, why not cut the fat wodge of paper in half and go 50% slimer in your office.
<br>If you're not sure how to do double sided printing, ask you IT person at work, or if you don't have one of them, check out info for Mac users and PC users.
<br>I also did this quick sketch to remind you.  You can download and print it off (on scrap paper of course) here, and stick it up in your office if you like.</p>
